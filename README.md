YouTube API V3 is a google service using the same engine to match videos to YouTube's database as per www.youtube.com. This app is designed to mimic the search aspect of this API to a string input from the client side via node-fetch. The frontend uses a few simple React.js components for its responsiveness to state change between when the backend has updated from a request. 

This is a work in progress with more features to be added as this project progresses.
